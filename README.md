#  Veterinary Assistant

> An AI-powered Cattle disease detection and health monitoring system built for the **VIRTUSA JatayuS4 TechMarshals Hackathon**

##  Overview

**Veterinary Assistant** is a comprehensive AI-based diagnostic platform designed to assist veterinarians and farm owners in early identification of cattle diseases. Leveraging **computer vision** and **language models**, the system operates both **offline and online**, making it ideal for rural areas with limited internet access.

The platform integrates:
- **YOLOv8 models** for real-time disease detection  
- **LangGraph + Mistral (via LangChain)** for veterinary report generation and for Rag
- **ChromaDB RAG** for AI assistance  
- **Grafana dashboards** for health monitoring and analytics  
- **PyQt5 GUI** for user-friendly offline desktop control  

##  Key Features

- ** AI-Powered Disease Detection**: Detects multiple cattle diseases using YOLOv8 with real-time camera input  
- ** Conversational AI Assistant (RAG)**: Built using LangChain + ChromaDB for veterinary queries  
- ** Offline & Online Deployment**: Works fully offline for field usage; integrates cloud sync based on the user selected Modes  
- ** Grafana Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time data visualization with local SQLite backend  
- ** Report Generation**: LangGraph-powered intelligent report summaries (Mistral 7B) and Visualization 
- ** Google Drive Sync**: Auto-upload Disease Detected Images to authenticated Drive folder for future model training  
- ** Location Mapping**: Get nearby vet clininc Details 
- ** Multi-Camera Input**: Supports 5–6 simultaneous camera streams from walking lanes  
- ** Secure & Encrypted**: Credentials and models encrypted using Python Fernet
